Figure1: Here we run the above command to install hardhat <br>

![h2](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Hardhat1/assets/89090776/51f6002f-5039-48af-8728-55e7bb3e653b)

Figure2: At our package dot json folder we can see the version of hardhat which is installed <br>

![h3](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Hardhat1/assets/89090776/f919cf84-f8c1-4132-91de-fd5c7621eb7e)

Figure3: If we run the above command it will show the above output

![h4](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Hardhat1/assets/89090776/4b143ade-2765-47b2-bf2d-6bef952d1eab)

figure4: here we will click ```Create javascript project``` <br>

![h5](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Hardhat1/assets/89090776/e0afa713-cec8-4844-9d7a-592a7aca0bef)

Figure5: here it asks for confirmation which directoty we want as a root for our project <br>


![h6](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Hardhat1/assets/89090776/d34a0f93-7af5-4815-91d1-030898ac61bc)

Figure6: here it instructs us to install some packages to run the sample project sown with yellow arrow <br>
Thus we have typed the command to install those packages shown with white arrow <br>

![h7](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Hardhat1/assets/89090776/af01dca7-d55e-4b64-82c7-d85efdad17d8)

Figure7: Then we give the above two commands as instructed <br>





![h9](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Hardhat1/assets/89090776/8c27e25b-fe98-4b1e-8504-423fa0c84896)

Figure9: to install solhint we will give the above command <br>

![h10](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Hardhat1/assets/89090776/b2b4d25f-1f70-4fbf-8ea0-b4961d4d9f0a)

figure10: Now we will give the above white mark command and it will install the above yellow mark file <br>

![h11](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Hardhat1/assets/89090776/a10c9d31-0143-4a19-96b5-d40ced660aad)

Figure11: To install prettierignore I have to do the above <br>

![h12](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Hardhat1/assets/89090776/761aa332-1464-4fdc-8698-f74fd07ae2ba)

Figure12: Thus we have advanced projects here <br>


### Linting


![h13](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Hardhat1/assets/89090776/03d9ac29-ddd3-4890-a8e7-e5fdf732b16f)

In the above figure ```solhint``` is known as solidity linter which is used to lint our code <br>

Linting is a process for running the progrramme that will ananlyze code for potential errors <br>

and the above .prettiarrc is used for formatting our code 


![h14](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Hardhat1/assets/89090776/eb0f1f8c-c7d8-4fbb-93d0-7e21f7024843)

Figure13: the above command is needed to install ```touch``` in windows by going to this link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36126269/touch-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command-operable-program-o  <br>
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64048830/yarn-2-init-add-failing


then we will give the below to command 

```
touch yarn.lock

yarn

```

to include yarn lock in this directory ```E:\akrkethjs\akrkethers-simple-storage\akrkhardhatFundme``` <br>


![h15](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Hardhat1/assets/89090776/3a2daca6-2059-4f25-8a66-30cfa1515599)

figure14: then we can see that here ```yarn.lock``` and inside of it necessary informations <br>

To add Solhint I have taken help from thsi github link   https://github.com/protofire/solhint<br>

![h16](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Hardhat1/assets/89090776/06e6a99c-745e-4fea-949e-5015e48f13c4)

Figure15: Then I have done the above <br>

![h17](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Hardhat1/assets/89090776/b09cf37e-0e59-4753-9977-2429fcbaa0f9)

Figure16: Here in the white arrow we have shown that we have added  rules at our solhint.json file <br>
which is if any variable is without visibility to show error as ouput in the console <br>

![h18](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_Hardhat1/assets/89090776/11f1d71a-a39d-4841-b2a6-641a43886038)

Figure17: In the white yerrow we can see we have remove the visibility in the two varibales <br>
Thus error is shown with yellow arrow at the console <br>
